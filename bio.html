                        <p> The knight was one of many vessels created to stop the infection, but was deemed a failure after
                            their brother, The Hollow Knight, was chosen by the Pale King. The knight was then thrown
                            into the abyss, where many other failed vessels were dumped, and climbed his way back out to
                            the starting point of the game.
                        </p>

                        <li>The Hollow Knight: Brother of the knight and the Pale King's chosen vessel, he was sent to contain the infection and save hallownest
                            from the infection. He failed because the Pale King had formed a connection with him, making him not truly hollow, and prone to infection.
                            After being infected, he killed the Pale King and was sealed in the Black Egg Temple. He is defeated by the Knight at the end of the game.

                        <li>The Radiance: Ruling god and origin of the infection. The Radiance was irritated that the Pale King took its place as the ruler of the land that became
                            Hallownest, so it created the infection to ravage the kingdom and force the Pale King to surrender. In the game's true ending, the Knight defeats the Radiance
                            and with it the infection, saving Hallownest from complete ruin.
