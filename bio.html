                        <p> The knight was one of many vessels created to stop the infection, but was deemed a failure after
                            their brother, The Hollow Knight, was chosen by the Pale King. The knight was then thrown
                            into the abyss, where many other failed vessels were dumped, and climbed his way back out to
                            the starting point of the game.
                        </p>

                            <li>Hornet: The half sister of the Knight and the Hollow Knight, she, like the Knight
                                is fighting against the infectio to try and save the crumbling remains of Hallownest.
                            </li>

                            <li>The Pale King: The father of the Knight, Hollow Kinght, Hornet, and all the other discarded vessels, 
                                He was a god who gave the residents of Hallownest
                                intellect. He replaced the Radiance as ruling god and was killed by the Hollow Knight after he failed 
                                to contain the infection.
                            </li>

                            <li> The White Lady: Mother of the Knight, Hollow Knight, and other discarded vessels, she doesn't do all that much.</li>
